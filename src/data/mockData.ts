    lyrics: `I think about that day\nI left him at a Greyhound station\nWest of Santa FÃ©\nWe were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true\nStill I did what I had to do\n'Cause I just knew\n\nSummer Sunday nights\nWe'd sink into our seats\nRight as they dimmed out all the lights\nA Technicolor world made out of music and machine\nIt called me to be on that screen\nAnd live inside each scene\n\nWithout a nickel to my name\nHopped a bus, here I came\nCould be brave or just insane\nWe'll have to see\n\n'Cause maybe in that sleepy town\nHe'll sit one day, the lights are down\nHe'll see my face and think of how he used to know me\n\nClimb these hills\nI'm reaching for the heights\nAnd chasing all the lights that shine\nAnd when they let you down\nYou'll get up off the ground\n'Cause morning rolls around\nAnd it's another day of sun\n\nI hear 'em ev'ry day\nThe rhythms in the canyons\nThat'll never fade away\nThe ballads in the barrooms\nLeft by those who came before\nThey say "you gotta want it more"\nSo I bang on ev'ry door\n\nAnd even when the answer's "no"\nOr when my money's running low\nThe dusty mic and neon glow\nAre all I need\n\nAnd someday as I sing my song\nA small-town kid'll come along\nThat'll be the thing to push him on and go go\n\nClimb these hills\nI'm reaching for the heights\nAnd chasing all the lights that shine\nAnd when they let you down\nYou'll get up off the ground\n'Cause morning rolls around\nAnd it's another day of sun\n\nAnd when they let you down\nThe morning rolls around\nIt's another day of sun\nIt's another day of sun\nIt's another day of sun\nJust another day of sun\nIt's another day of sun\nAnother day has just begun\nIt's another day of sun\nIt's another day of sun`,
